2. **Multiply:**
   ```css
   mix-blend-mode: multiply;
   ```

3. **Screen:**
   ```css
   mix-blend-mode: screen;
   ```

4. **Overlay:**
   ```css
   mix-blend-mode: overlay;
   ```

5. **Darken:**
   ```css
   mix-blend-mode: darken;
   ```

6. **Lighten:**
   ```css
   mix-blend-mode: lighten;
   ```

7. **Color Dodge:**

.my-element {
  mix-blend-mode: overlay;
}
```

Experimenting with these blend modes can result in unique and creative designs for your web pages. Keep in mind that not
all blend modes may be supported in all browsers, so it's essential to check compatibility for your target audience.
