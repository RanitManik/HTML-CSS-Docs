# Inline, Internal & External CSS

## Introduction

Welcome to the realm of CSS styling, where we explore different approaches to enhance the appearance of your web pages.
In this guide, we'll unravel the mysteries of Inline, Internal, and External CSS, providing you with the tools to craft
visually stunning and well-organized websites.

## Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves styling individual HTML elements directly within the tags using the `style` attribute. While it's
quick for small adjustments, it's not always the most efficient for extensive styling.

### Example:

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a styled paragraph.</p>
```

- **Pros:**
    - Quick and straightforward for small changes.
    - Overrides external and internal styles.

- **Cons:**
    - Not recommended for extensive styling.
    - Mixes style with content, reducing maintainability.

## Internal CSS

Internal CSS is applied within the `<style>` tag in the HTML document's `<head>` section. It allows you to style
multiple elements on a single page without affecting other pages.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
            background-color: #f8f8f8;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a styled heading.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Pros:**
    - Centralized styling for a specific page.
    - Separation of concerns (style and content).

- **Cons:**
    - Styling limited to the current HTML document.

## External CSS

External CSS involves linking a separate CSS file to your HTML document. This method promotes maintainability and
reusability, making it ideal for styling multiple pages consistently.

### Example (style.css):

```css
/* style.css */
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a styled heading.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Pros:**
    - Centralized styling for multiple pages.
    - Easy maintenance and updates.

- **Cons:**
    - Requires an additional file.
    - May slightly increase page load time (due to an additional HTTP request).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding when to use Inline, Internal, or External CSS is crucial for effective web styling. Inline
is quick but best for minor adjustments, Internal is suitable for styling a single page, while External is the preferred
choice for consistent styling across multiple pages. Choose the approach that best suits your project's needs and
complexity. Happy styling!
