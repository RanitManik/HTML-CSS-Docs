## HTML Conclusion

Before diving into the specifics, let's emphasize the importance of mastering HTML. HTML, as the foundation of web
development, is crucial for creating organized, accessible, and visually appealing web pages. A solid understanding of
HTML ensures the effective structuring of content, forming the basis for a seamless user experience.

## HTML Entities and Special Symbols

### HTML Entities

HTML entities are used to represent characters that might otherwise be misinterpreted as code. They play a critical role
in displaying reserved characters without disrupting the HTML structure.

#### Examples:

- `&lt;` represents `<`.
- `&gt;` represents `>`.
- `&amp;` represents `&`.

### Special Symbols

HTML provides special symbols for various purposes, enhancing content presentation.

#### Examples:

- `&reg;` represents ® (registered trademark symbol).
- `&nbsp;` represents a non-breaking space.

### Quotation Tags and Obsolete HTML Tags

Quotation tags are essential for indicating the beginning and end of quotations. Modern HTML uses `<q>` for inline
quotations, while obsolete tags like `<blockquote>` still exist for block-level quotations.They help screen readers to
recognize them.

#### Example:

```html

<blockquote>
    <p>This is a block-level quotation.</p>
</blockquote>
```

### Code Tag and Prism.js Library

The `<code>` tag is used to define a piece of computer code. To enhance code presentation and syntax highlighting, the
Prism.js library can be employed.

#### Example:

```html
<code class="language-html">
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
