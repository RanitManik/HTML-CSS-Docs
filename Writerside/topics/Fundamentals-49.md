# CSS Object-fit and Object-cover

The `object-fit` property in CSS is used to control how an `<img>` or `<video>` element's content should be resized to
fit its container. Meanwhile, `object-cover` is a specific value for `object-fit` that maintains the aspect ratio of the
content and covers the entire container.

## `object-fit` Property

The `object-fit` property has several values, and it determines how the content of the replaced element should be fitted
to the box established by its used height and width.

**Example:**

```css
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

In this example, the `object-fit: cover` property ensures that the image covers the entire specified dimensions (200px
by 150px) while maintaining its aspect ratio.

## `object-cover` Value

The `object-cover` value is a specific option for the `object-fit` property. When applied, it scales the content
proportionally and clips it so that it entirely covers the box.

**Example:**

```css
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  object-fit: object-cover;
}
```

In this case, the image will be proportionally scaled to cover the entire specified dimensions (200px by 150px), and any
excess content will be clipped.

## Common Use Cases

### Responsive Image Containers

```css
.img-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 300px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.img-container img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

This example creates a responsive image container that maintains a fixed height of 300px. The `object-fit: cover`
property ensures that the image scales proportionally to cover the container while being fully visible.

### Thumbnail Images

```css
.thumbnail {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

For a set of thumbnail images, applying `object-fit: cover` ensures that each thumbnail is a fixed size (100px by 100px)
while preserving the aspect ratio of the image.

### Video Background

```css
.video-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.video-container video {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

To create a video background, the `object-fit: cover` property can be used to scale the video content proportionally and
cover the entire container.

## Conclusion

The `object-fit` property, especially when using `object-cover`, is a valuable tool for controlling the sizing and
scaling of replaced elements like images and videos. It allows developers to create responsive designs and visually
compelling layouts while maintaining the integrity of the content's aspect ratio.
